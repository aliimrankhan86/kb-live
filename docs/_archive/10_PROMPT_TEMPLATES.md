You are taking over implementation support for KaabaTrip.

4. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
5. docs/SECURITY.md
6. docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md

Repo state:

- Current commit: <PASTE HASH>

Rules:

- Work only in micro-tasks.
- Each task must include: goal, allowed files, steps, acceptance criteria, commands to run, docs impact.
- Assume I will apply changes in VS Code and run commands locally.
- If you suggest code, keep it to the smallest diff possible.

First job:
Propose the next 3 micro-tasks for Phase 2 in priority order with acceptance criteria and test plan.
