# Archive (docs)

This folder is for **superseded or duplicated** docs that have been replaced by a canonical version or consolidated elsewhere.

- **Rule:** When a doc is duplicated (e.g. same content in two files), move the duplicate here and add a one-line note at the top pointing to the canonical doc.
- **Canonical pointers already in repo:** `05_SECURITY.md` → `SECURITY.md`; `06_ACCESSIBILITY.md` → `ACCESSIBILITY.md`. Those remain as pointers; do not move them here unless they are removed from the index.
- No files have been moved here in the initial skills-pack setup; use this when you consolidate or supersede a doc.
